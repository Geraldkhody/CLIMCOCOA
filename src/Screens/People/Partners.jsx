The representative from RUC has a human/social geography background. ICRAF and IITA are key participating international institutions due to their strong track record in cocoa and climate change research, and because of their on-going networks of on-farm studies in cocoa producing areas of Ghana. The ICRAF team will consist of an economist, a geographer and an ecophysiologist joined by a cocoa agroforester from IITA. The expected contribution of each scientist is shown in Table 4.",
