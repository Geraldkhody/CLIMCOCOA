            Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) is the third highest export commodity of
            Ghana and represents the most important source of revenue for
            numerous small scale farmers. Climate change (CC) in the form of
            higher temperatures and reduced rainfall is expected to adversely
            affect cocoa productivity and reduce the area suitable for cocoa
            cultivation in Ghana, but the extent and underlying mechanisms are
            not well understood. The CLIMCOCOA project aims to develop a
            comprehensive understanding of the impacts of CC on the
            socio-biophysical bases of cocoa systems in Ghana, and assess the
            role of agroforestry (AF) as a model for climate smart agriculture
            in Ghana. We will use a multidisciplinary approach to investigate
            the socio-biophysical limitations and options for cocoa cultivation
            under CC, and to assess institutional and socioeconomic factors that

            Ghana and neighboring Côte d’Ivoire produces around 60% of the world
            production of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.), one of the world’s major
            commodities. In 2010 cocoa accounted for 8.2% of Ghana’s GDP and 30%
            of total export earnings, creating employment for about 6 million
            people and a livelihood for 700.000 cocoa farming families (GAIN,
            2012, Asante-Poku & Angelucci, 2013),thus representing an important
            pillar in both rural and urban poverty alleviation and development
            of the economy of Ghana at large. An increasing global demand for
            cocoa and a production gap in the global market suggest a further
            growth potential for cocoa and thus a continued significant role for
            farmers and businesses in Ghana. Climate models predict temperature
            increases from 1-2.5 °C for Ghana by 2050. Although precipitation
            patterns are more uncertain, it seems that future climates will be
            highly variable and more prone to drought and temperature extremes.
            According to Läderach et al (2013), areas suitable for cocoa
            cultivation in Ghana will decrease due to a temperature mediated
            increase in evapotranspiration not compensated by increasing
            rainfall, i.e. a decrease in water availability rather than by the
            direct effect of increasing air temperature. This will increase the
            risk of drought to which cocoa is very susceptible. In their study,
            Läderach et al (2013) simulated impacts of CC limited to the
            definition of the suitable area for cocoa based on a generic model
            that does not take into account the effects of CC on cocoa yield, as
            it is not specific to cocoa ecophysiology and does not integrate the
            effects that CC will have on pests and diseases. Furthermore, these
            simulations 2 on potential cocoa growing areas do not take into
            account the adaptation strategies that farmers will be developing or
            adopting to cope with CC. Furthermore, literature reviews reveal a
            surprising lack of knowledge of the response of different cocoa
            systems to extreme climatic events making predictions uncertain
            (Zuidema et al., 2005). In addition there is little if any knowledge
            on adaptive measures in the light of climate change, especially
            among cocoa communities in Ghana.
